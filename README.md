# Morse-to-Text-Converter
A simple morse code to text converter.
That was an exercise for my college and i remember google was a mess 
about this conversion program, so here is a simple solution.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Pr0xe/Morse-to-Text-Converter.git
$ cd Morse-to-Text-Converter
$ make
$ ./en2mo
or
$ ./mo2en
```
